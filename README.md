## Usage with GitHub Codespaces
GitHub Codespaces allows you to spin up a fully configured development environment directly within your browser, making it easy to run Jupyter notebooks without any local setup. Here's how to use GitHub Codespaces with this repository:

1. Click on the "Code" button and select "Open with Codespaces".
2. GitHub will create a new Codespace for you and launch it in your browser.
3. Once the Codespace is ready, it will install the necessary extensions and requirements automatically. 
5. Go to either `Test1.ipynb, Test2.ipynb or Test3.ipynb` and run the desired Jupyter notebook.
   - it will ask you to choose your kernel, select python and choose your python version.

## Contents
- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `Test1, Test2 & Test3`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the notebooks.
