# Usage with GitHub Codespaces
GitHub Codespaces allows you to spin up a fully configured development environment directly within your browser, making it easy to run Jupyter notebooks without any local setup. Here's how to use GitHub Codespaces with this repository:

1. Click on the "Code" button and select "Create codespace on main".
2. GitHub will create a new Codespace for you and launch it in your browser.
3. Once the Codespace is ready, it will install the necessary extensions and requirements automatically. 
5. Go to either `Test1.ipynb`, `Test2.ipynb` or `Test3.ipynb` and click 'Run all' to run the desired Jupyter notebook.
   - it will ask you to choose your kernel, so, select python environments and choose your python version (probably go with recommended).
  
6. See produced results and diagrams. Thank you for viewing my project repo!
